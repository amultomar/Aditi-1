      "Is this a subscription? Will I be charged again?",

      "No. Issue I is a single purchase — one payment, no auto-renewal, nothing recurring. A full subscription opens in July with our new website, but it will always sit alongside the option to buy a single issue. You commit to nothing today beyond this one issue.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I've never read defence or strategy writing. Is this for me?",

      "Yes — that's exactly who it's for. ADITI takes the depth of a strategic briefing and writes it in plain language. You don't need a defence background.",

    question: "Who actually writes it?",

      "India's most senior strategic voices — veterans who commanded at the highest levels of the Army, Navy and Air Force, alongside the scholars shaping the strategic discourse",
  },
  {
    question: "Is ADITI political?",
    answer:
      "No. ADITI analyses strategy, not party politics. It is deliberately independent and rigorously analytical — the goal is clearer thinking about Indian power, not a position to defend.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I read a bit before I buy?",
    answer:
      "Yes — three primers are open and free. Read them here. They show you exactly how ADITI reasons before you spend a rupee.",

  {
    question:
      "When is the next issue, and will I get it?",
    answer:
      "Issue II — Forging the Republic's Power — arrives in July. Buy Issue I now and you'll be reading ADITI from its very first edition — first in line for every issue that follows.",
